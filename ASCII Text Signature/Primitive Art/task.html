<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>An ASCII generator is an awesome program that can output any document, picture, or text file in 2-D using only text symbols. It is often used to print signatures for various conferences and meetings. One example of a signature is a name tag, a small piece of paper with your name printed on it. In this project, you will write an ASCII generator that can print name tags.</p>

<p>Let's start with generating the simplest signature. A name tag usually consists of a name and a surname. Your task is to generate a tag for someone with the first name "Hyper" and the last name "Skill". You also need the text to be bordered by straight lines across all four sides, as shown in the example.</p>

<p>Note that left and right borders are marked with the symbol <code class="java">'|'</code>, the top border is marked with  <code class="java">'_'</code>, and the bottom border is marked with <code class="java">'•'</code>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Output example</h2>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight"> _____________
| Hyper Skill |
 •••••••••••••</code></pre>
