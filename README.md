# ASCII-Art-tag
Program that reads a name and a status and prints a tag using an external file with a pre-set ASCII font 
In this project I iterate through an external file, then mapped it  to a list of strings, then used fold to iterate through a name and a status, 
accumulating the strings from the external file, after that I entered the texts and print them surrounded by a margin
